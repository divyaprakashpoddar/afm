These contain some python codes used for teaching my Advanced Fluid Mehanics class.
There are also some python codes to download data from the John Hopkins Turbulence Database and to plot the law of the wall and the log law using the data for a turbulent boundary layer. These codes have been written by looking at the examples provided at http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/
